          <h3>Frontend</h3>
          <p>
            I have experience in both frontend and backend development. On the
            frontend, I am proficient in <strong>JavaScript</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong>CSS</strong>. I use these
            technologies to build responsive and dynamic web applications. I
            have also worked with design tools like
            <strong>Figma</strong> to create clean and user-friendly interfaces.

        <div className="card">
          <h3>Backend</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of backend, I am comfortable with <strong>Node.js</strong>{" "}
            for building server-side applications and have used databases like{" "}
            <strong>DynamoDB</strong> and <strong>neDB</strong> for data
            storage. Additionally, I am familiar with <strong>AWS</strong>{" "}
            services such as Lambda, API Gateway, and S3, which help me build
            scalable, serverless applications.

          <h3>Api Testing</h3>
          <p>
            I have also used <strong>Postman</strong> to test APIs and ensure
            smooth integration between frontend and backend. Finally, I am
            passionate about <strong>UX/UI Design</strong> and constantly strive
            to improve the user experience of the applications I develop.

          <p>
            By the time I start my LIA, I will have completed my fullstack
            development course, enabling me to work both as a frontend, backend,
            or fullstack developer during my internship. This includes building
            and maintaining complete applications from frontend to backend.
